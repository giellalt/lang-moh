personal prefix + root

we will start with only I, you and he

Morphophonology
To represent phonologic variations in word forms we use the following
symbols in the lexicon files:

## Flag diacritics
We have manually optimised the structure of our lexicon using following
flag diacritics to restrict morhpological combinatorics - only allow compounds
with verbs if the verb is further derived into a noun again:


The word forms in Mohawk language start from the lexeme roots of basic
word classes, or optionally from prefixes:
